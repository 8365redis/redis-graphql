## Build

After preparing the build environment just run :

```
make DEBUG=1
```

## Load

To load the development module you can use these commands: 

```
redis-server --loadmodule ./bin/redis-graphql.so
```

or 

```
make load
```

## Test
Development is done by `Python 3.10.2` but any version after `3.6.X` should be fine. To install needed python packages just run (generated by `pipreqs`): 

```
pip install -r python/requirements.txt
```

For test purposes you can use the python client. To run the tests just run (Run the tests with DEBUG build): 

```

You can also the `graphene_test.py` to validate the graphql responses.
